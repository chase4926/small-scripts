Just some small miscellaneous scripts.


format_series.rb
---
I actually use this a ton for formatting totally legally downloaded tv episodes.
It pulls all of the episode information from theTVDB.com.
  
###Usage:

```
formatseries.rb {options} SeriesName path/to/series/directory  
-h   --help      Displays this information  
-v   --verbose   Displays debug information  
-d   --dry       Does a 'dry run'
```

list_directories.rb
---
This just lists the sub-directories of multiple directories.
I use this to make a list of movies from multiple movie library directories.
