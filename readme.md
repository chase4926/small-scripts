Just some small miscellaneous scripts.


format_series.rb
---
I actually use this a ton for formatting totally legally downloaded tv episodes.
It pulls all of the episode information from theTVDB.com. It's not user friendly
at all and requires the last two lines to be altered to change the showname and
season path.

list_directories.rb
---
This just lists the sub-directories of multiple directories.
I use this to make a list of movies from multiple movie library directories.
